                <p >We are recruiting experienced software professionals (of all types, not just programmers) to volunteer as mentors for our young superstars. We want them to each have at least a few external role models, who can provide unbiased career advise, second opinions on issues that may crop up, congratulations when deserved, and a virtual shoulder to cry on when times are bad. Fellows are expected to devote at least 30-60 minutes per week communicating with each of their mentors.
